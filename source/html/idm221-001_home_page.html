				<p> My name is Kameron Kutz and I am a freshman attending Drexel University.  My major is Interactive Digital Media, which deals with designing and programming advanced technology as well as working with apps and websites.  People in my major have been working on technologies such as a fully digitalized motorcycle helmets and designing user interfaces for various websites and apps.  This kind of work has always interested my ever since I was a kid.  I always enjoyed various forms of media like apps, games, music, websites, and movies.  Anything that conveyed a message to a user and would make them feel content.</p>  
 
				<p> Something I am very passionate about are videogames.  They have been something that has been with me throughout most of my life.  They even help me when I am going through tough times because they are there to comfort me as well as challenge me.  They often make me think of things I would not normally think about.  For instance, when I am fighting a boss in a game I think of various ways to overcome whatever I am fighting and try different methods.  This is much like real life, when I have a challenge I need to find multiple ways to overcome that challenge.</p>

				<p> Being at Drexel has been a fun experience and all my classes are enjoyable.  I feel Drexel can help me accomplish my dreams of working at a prestigious company that deals with digital media.  One of my dream jobs is to work at Apple, Google, Twitter, or Snapchat.  However, I have had ideas of starting up my own company and investing time and money into my ideas.  My friends and I like to brainstorm different business ideas day-to-day to keep our creativity and conviction flowing.</p>    

				<p> My goal in life is to live as free as possible.  My motto is to live life how you want to and be happy with who you are as a person.  I think living life to the fullest is an attribute everyone should try to model.  I also beleive in making connections the more you put yourself out there and make friends, the more you as a person will be able to expand your horizons.  The more connections you make in life the more knowledge you will have as well as channels to better work ethics. Something I always keep in mind when working is one of my biggest dreams, to have a house on a beautiful island.</p>
