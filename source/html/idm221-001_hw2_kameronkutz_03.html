			<h1>Goals of the Site</h1>
			<h3>Usability/Structure</h3>
				<p>I plan to have a functional website that offers full usability for anyone visiting it.  This is the first website I will have ever created so structure is important.  I want to make my website easy and accessible for everyone so there is no confusion.  I think it will be pertinent that everything in the site is structured properly for the user so they understand how to navigate it.</p>
			<h3>Design Elements</h3>
				<p>Even though we have not learned any CSS currently,I hope to make my site look aesthetically pleasing.  A good looking site is important because it is what the users will be judging the website off of.  A website with good content and looks are usaully the best websites out there because they draw the user in and have the info they are looking for.  I aim to create a good looking site with all the functionality it needs.</p>
			<h3>Long Term</h3>
				<p>I aim to have this site for quite a while throughout my time here at Drexel and maybe even after.  This is going to be the start of my portfolio website so I hope to show it off to possible coop employers as well as friends and family to get feedback from.  I want to take what I learn in this class and apply it to all my work and continue to update this site.  A couple years from now I want to look back at this first site I made and see how far I've come.</p>
