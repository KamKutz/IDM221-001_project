				<p id="mainpar"> My name is Kameron Kutz and I am a freshman attending Drexel University.  My major is Interactive Digital Media, which deals with designing and programming advanced technology as well as working with apps and websites.  People in my major have been working on technologies such as a fully digitalized motorcycle helmets and designing user interfaces for various websites and apps.  This kind of work has always interested my ever since I was a kid.  I always enjoyed various forms of media like apps, games, music, websites, and movies.  Anything that conveyed a message to a user and would make them feel content.</p>
