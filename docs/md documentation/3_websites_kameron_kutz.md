# 3 Websites

This website portrays the endangered species of the world in a unique and interesting way.  I like how this website is different from all the rest and you can see that instantly upon entering the site.  One of the reasons is from the somber tone right away with the music it plays in the backgroud.  Depending on the purpose of the website, if there is music or not, can really change how the user views it. I also really enjoy the CSS based polygon animations that fly around the screen when you view the endangered species.  Having appealing features is important, especially when it is on the visual side. The statistics it allows you to explore when you click for further info on the animal is a nice extra touch.  The color scheme of the website is also very appealing and every color works together greatly.

The main purpose of this website is to buy clothes and comes from a reputable brand, Urban Outfitters.  I generally like how this website is layed out and have used it in the past before.  I like how the modules display a large amount of the page when that is the primary focus for the user.  This technique really grabs the attention of a person depending on how the site plans to direct the user.  For this websites purpose it is to look at and buy clothes so it is quite important.  I also like when my mouse hovers over a certain module it lightens up letting me know I am hovering over it.  When you go to view items, they are layed out nicely on the page and are all equally spaced apart.  I think even spacing of objects on websites is important because it portrays neatness, depending if your website's goal is that or not.  I think this site could use more icons if applicable.  Specifically, the log in icon could stand out a bit more to the user.

Dosie Dough is an website for two small town bakeries located in Wyomissing and Lititz. This website is interesting to be because the first thing you see is a big horizontal picture with minimal text.  Most websites I go to bombard the user with text whether it be unnecessary or not.  However, this website does a nice job of not overwhelming a user with text, which I enjoy.  This could also be a double-sided sword because the less text you have the less you are communicating to the user.  The overall aesthetic of the website is nice and the information you need to know about the bakery is there as you scroll through.  The one complaint I have about this website, are the testimonials found at the bottom of the page.  If you scroll down the testimonials fade transition from one to another, which I like.  However, occasionally it will jolt your page quickly up and down disorienting the user.  I think this website could find a better way of displaying their testimonials to users.
